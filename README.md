# Personal Portfolio

## Project Description
---
This project's purpose is to display the many different projects I have coded and the skills I have gained from them. This is kinda similar to a resume but for coding projects, becuase it is somewhat of a list of programming acheivements and skills I have accomplished and earned. This project lets you see descriptions of and use/play programs that I have made and helped make.
Paragraph describing the purpose of your project and what it does.

## Author's Information
---
The author of this project is Luke Murdock and he is a student at UCAS, currently taking a programming class and creating projects like this one to help him learn python and the basics of programming. He mostly enjoys coding, expecially when it doesn't have many bugs and has a fun end product. He enjoys lots of other things including reading and playing games, including video games. He thinks it would be fun to eventually make some sort of actual game in the future if he ever gets the oppurtunity.
