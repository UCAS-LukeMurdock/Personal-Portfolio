    if they choose games
        -(Vincent part)
    if they choose scores
        -ask user if they want to see profiles, scores, menu
    if they choose to exit the program
        -the program closes
    if they choose profile
        -ask if that profile exsit
    if it does exsit
        -it'll print the score of that profile
    if it doesnt exsit
        -tell the user it doesnt exsit
        -then go back (ask user if they want to see profiles, scores, or menu)
    if they choose to see scores 
        -ask the user if they want to see the reaction or guessing games score
        -VINCENT'S PART
         Sort scores by highest to lowest
        -display the scores
        -take the user back to the (ask user if they want to see profiles, scores, or menu)

THIS IS FOR SORTING THE USER'S SCORES!

users = {
  "Alice": {"game1": 50, "game2": 70},
  "Bob": {"game1": 85, "game2": 60},
  "Charlie": {"game1": 90, "game2": 55},
}
sorted_users = sorted(users.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['game1'], reverse=True)
for user, scores in sorted_users:
  print(f"{user}: {scores['game1']}")


The ##sorted()## function is employed to sort the items in the users dictionary. The lambda function serves as the sorting key.
##users.items()## returns a view of the dictionary's items as pairs of (key, value).
The lambda function lambda item: ##item[1]['game1']## tells the sorting function to use the score for "game1" (which is the second part of each item) as the key for sorting.
##reverse=True## sorts the scores in descending order (highest to lowest).
